# Galveston

An experimental engine and compiler for interactive ω-word games.

Galveston is an ω-language over the alphabet `Σ = {NUL, v1, v2, ...}`. A program in Galveston is a single ω-word from that language,
 i.e. a countably infinite sequence made up of symbols from a countably infinite totally-ordered alphabet.
